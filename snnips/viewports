@media screen and (min-width:320px){} // mobile portrait
@media screen and (min-width:480px){} // mobile landscape
@media screen and (min-width:768px){} // ipad portrait
@media screen and (min-width:1024px){} // browser, ipad landscape
@media screen and (min-width:1200px){} // browser
@media screen and (min-width:1600px){} // browser

No point trying to cover all the different android etc resolutions...there are so many.

Also sometimes the breakpoints don't trigger on the actual size due to the scrollbar, which each browser has different rules for. Might be wise to cut off 20px per @media to make sure they trigger. I sometimes swap the min-width:320px for a max-width: 480px, as under 320 nothing might be displayed.
